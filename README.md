# NeetCode Solutions in Java 21

## Project Description

This repository contains solutions to NeetCode problems implemented in Java 21.
The main goal of this repository is
to provide a comprehensive collection of solutions for various data structures and algorithm problems,
showcasing clean code and thorough testing practices.

## Structure

The repository is organized into multiple subprojects, each representing a different problem or topic.
Each subproject contains its own `README.md` with specific details about the implementation and testing.

## Features

- Solutions to various NeetCode problems.
- Implementation of data structures and algorithms in clean Java code.
- Comprehensive test cases for each implementation.
- Detailed documentation for each subproject.
- Full test coverage for all implementations.

## Requirements

- Java 21

## Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to the specific subproject directory. 
Follow the instructions in the subproject's `README.md` to compile and run the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samvel-aivazian/neetcode.git
cd neetcode/core_skills/implement_data_structures/design_singly_linked_list
javac -cp . org/samvelaivazian/linkedlist/*.java
java -ea org.samvelaivazian.linkedlist.LinkedListTest
```
